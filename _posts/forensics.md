Let's start off right away with what Forensics is. When most people hear the word 'Forensics', they tend to think of Forensic science, and or the investigation of a case.  The less known meaning of the word "forensics" comes from ancient Greece where the term was applied to speeches made to convince a group of people who would make a judgment based on the arguments and evidence presented in the speech. 

In my junior and senior year of highschool at Walled Lake Northern, I joined the Michigan Interscholastic Forensics Association (MIFA).  While initially I wasn't very good at speaking, my first year trained me in writing informative, persausive essay's with the goal of making my listeners take action, or in the least, contemplate the idea. 

Forensic's is broken up into different catagories: Dramatic Interpretation, and Public Address.
Dramatic Interpretation consists of poetry, books, interpretation of film writing, and other roleplaying-like aspects.
On the other hand, my catagory, Public Address, is the seriousness of real life problems of covering of newsworthy topics. 

In my case, my subsection of forensics was 'Oratory'. This subsection of Public Address includes the writing on a topic in the effort to persaude the listeners to take action for a cause. In my senoir year, I wrote my peice on "Going Green in the Industry", covering the many pros which come to business for investing in green practices, such as the reuse of excess materails, or use of solar panels to save on the cost of energy a factory or workplace may use.

Overall, I ended taking this peice on to state finals, which I ended up being 5th place overall in the state-wide competition.
