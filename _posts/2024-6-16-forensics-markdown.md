Let's start off right away with what Forensics is. When most people hear the word 'Forensics', they tend to think of forensic science and the investigation of a case. The less known meaning of the word "forensics" comes from ancient Greece, where the term was applied to speeches made to convince a group of people who would make a judgment based on the arguments and evidence presented in the speech.

In my junior and senior years of high school at Walled Lake Northern, I joined the **Michigan Interscholastic Forensics Association** (MIFA). While initially I wasn't very good at speaking, my first year trained me in writing informative, persuasive essays with the goal of making my listeners take action, or at the very least, contemplate the idea.

Forensics is broken up into different categories: Dramatic Interpretation and Public Address.
Dramatic Interpretation consists of poetry, books, interpretation of film writing, and other role-playing-like aspects.
On the other hand, my category, Public Address, is about covering newsworthy topics with the seriousness of real-life problems.

In my case, my subsection of forensics was 'Oratory'. This subsection of Public Address includes writing on a topic in the effort to persuade the listeners to take action for a cause.
In my senior year, I wrote my piece on "Going Green in the Industry," covering the many pros that come to businesses for investing in green practices, such as the reuse of excess materials or the use of solar panels to save on the cost of energy a factory or workplace may use.

Overall, I ended up taking this piece on to state finals, where I ended up placing 5th overall in the statewide competition.
