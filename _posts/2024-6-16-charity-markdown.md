 In my free time, I help out with fundraisers for local charities. These fundraisers include all sorts of actvities per charity, most notably the handling of admission tickets and currency at fundrasing events, or directing the prepation of the fundrasier's setup.

 My favorite fundrasier is the **Walled Lake Civic's Fund**, which focuses on raising money via a variety of fundraisers, such as a city golf outing, to a beach day, in which downtown Walled Lake, people can stop by and partake in a plethora of fun summer themed events for a small admission price.  ALl proceeds end up going towards a end of June fireworks show, in which all citizens and friends of Walled Lake can come and watch as fireworks are launched from the middle of the lake for a spectacular fireworks show.

 It's been a annual way to bring the community together, and it's always been a *blast*.
