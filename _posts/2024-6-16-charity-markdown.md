In my free time, I help out with fundraisers for local charities. These fundraisers include a variety of activities per charity, most notably the handling of admission tickets and currency at fundraising events, or directing the preparation of the fundraiser's setup.

My favorite fundraiser is the **Walled Lake Civic's Fund**, which focuses on raising money through a variety of fundraisers, such as a city golf outing, to a beach day. In downtown Walled Lake, people can stop by and partake in a plethora of fun, summer-themed events for a small admission price. All proceeds go towards an end-of-June fireworks show, where all citizens and friends of Walled Lake can come and watch as fireworks are launched from the middle of the lake for a spectacular display.

It's been an annual way to bring the community together, and it's always been a *blast*.
